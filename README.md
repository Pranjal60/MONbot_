<h1>MONbot</h1>
<h2>MONbot is a <mark>quadruped robot</mark> which is our project for the  <mark>Change.Makers</mark> summer bootcamp for high school students organized by <mark>The Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi.</mark> The main reason for choosing this project is to gain knowledge about robotics, electronics, software, user-need and many more! This is why the project right-now has hard-coded values for movements. </h2>
<br><br><br> 
<h2>We are still into the development phase of this project with some common motions like fordward, backward, up, and down movement. We are planning to improvise these motions and work upon the hip joint to get more <mark>Degrees of freedom.</mark></h2>
<br><br><br> 
<h2>The project inspired form Boston Dynamics and Petoi Bittle has a good deal of applications, ranging from <mark>fun ... to navigation ...to defence support!</h2>
